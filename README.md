Welcome to LeoFS
=================

Overview
--------

LeoFS is the Web shaped object storage system and S3 compatible storage.

Feature
--------

* One-Huge Storage
    * LeoFS is the Web shaped object storage system.
    * LeoFS is built to operate in highly distributed environments, such as the private cloud.
    * LeoFS has NO SPOF.
    * LeoFS's cluster consists of a set of loosely connected nodes. So, They can be viewed as ONE-Huge Storage.
    * LeoFS is made by modular-system. So, It realizes a lower cost of operations.
* 3-HIGHs
    * LeoFS is highly scalable, fault-tolerant Distributed File System for the Web.
    * Different than other DFS â€” LeoFS offers a number of unique benefits to users:
       * HIGH cost performance
       * HIGH Reliability
       * HIGH Scalability
* S3 Compatible
    * LeoFS is Amazon S3 compatible storage system.
